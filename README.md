# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Implementation Details

> Code should be extensible enough for us to change to a different endpoint at any point in the future with little or no need for code modification.

For this we use an `API_URL` environment variable that can be used to override the default endpoint.

> Perform verification on the response above.

Response verification is done via prop-type verifications which report violations to the browser console.

> On the organization level check which date is newer (created_at/updated_at) and indicate in some way which one is newer visually.

We render a red tag next to either date if one is greater than the other.

> Error and exception handling.

We leverage the `catch` feature of `Promise`s to acheive this. `try/catch` is another alternative if you use the `async/await` style syntax.

> You must use sass for stylesheets and those must compile into CSS.

The default `webpack` process provided via `create-react-app` allows this via the `sass` package which was installed after the project was created as `css` is the default language for styles. If `sass` is installed then our .sass files are transpiled at build time accordingly.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
